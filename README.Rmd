The goal of amazonasdatahub is to gather various data sets from the state of Amazonas (AM), Brazil, to which Deep Learning can be applied.

With this open-source R package, you will have access to various datasets to apply Deep Learning and statistical methods.

## Installation

To install amazonasdatahub, you need to have the following tools installed on your computer or development environment:

- R version 4.41.1 (2024-06-14) – “Race for Your Life”;
- devtools package from R.

You can install the development version of amazonasdatahub from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Install devtools package
install.packages("devtools")

# Load devtools
library(devtools)

# installing amazonasdatahub
devtools::install_github("Nelson-DevStack/amazonasdatahub")
```

## Usage

Once the ```amazonasdatahub``` is installed, use library() or require() to load the package.

```{r}
library(amazonasdatahub)
```

You can see the documentation of each dataset using the help operator "?".
```{r, eval = FALSE}
?agriculture_idam
?aids_amazonas
?gdp_amazonas
?humidity_manaus
?malaria_amazonas
?prf_amazonas
?rionegro_amazonas
?school_read_levels
```

## Example

The dataset ```aids_amazonas``` contains data of the AIDS occurrences in each municipality from Amazonas.

One of the analysis that can be made is: visualize the time series of counts filtered by municipality, where each case is grouped by the sex/gender of each observation. To do this, we will use the dplyr package to structure the data and the ggplot2 package to create and customize the chart.

```{r message=FALSE, results='hide', warning=FALSE}
# Loading dplyr and ggplot to structure the data
require(dplyr)
require(ggplot2)
```

```{r, dpi = 300}
# Filtering by municipality and plotting case count by gender
aids_amazonas %>%
  filter(name_muni == "Manaus") %>%
  group_by(gender) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = cases, group = gender, color = gender)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    title = "AIDS ocurrences in Manaus (2011-2023)",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Case count",
    color = "Gender"
  )
```
